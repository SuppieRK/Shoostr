# Shoostr diagnostics in Actions

Run **Shoostr benchmarks** manually from the Actions tab. Select the branch,
`steady` or `overload`, and artifact retention (1–14 days, default 7).
The workflow requires its support files on the selected branch. It does not run
benchmarks on pushes or pull requests.

Steady mode runs eight HTTP workloads (plaintext, pre-encoded JSON, 1 KiB echo,
16 KiB flushed stream, literal routing, parameter routing, 404 and 405), three SSE
workloads (burst, paced and callback-delayed large events), and three WebSocket
workloads (text, binary and callback-delayed large frames). Each workload has its
own Linux runner. Its three trials use fresh JVMs, a 10-second warmup, and a
180-second offered-load phase. Up to fourteen workload jobs run concurrently;
GitHub may queue jobs when account capacity is unavailable.

Overload mode runs only the eight HTTP workloads. Each trial offers 1,000, 2,000,
5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 and 100,000 requests/second in 15-second plateaus with
five-second drains. Threshold breaches appear as **OVERLOAD**, while startup,
tooling, profiling and publication failures fail the workflow. Steady-mode
correctness failures also fail the workflow. The load generator can saturate
before the service; inspect both processes before interpreting a boundary.

Slow-WebSocket steady traffic uses one session/second: the initial hosted trial
at ten sessions/second saturated the two-CPU k6 client and failed during warmup.
Payload validation, callback delay, timeouts and correctness checks are unchanged.

The build job prepares one fixture distribution and one pinned k6 binary with
the SSE extension. Workload jobs reuse those binaries and a 256 MiB fixed G1
heap. Available CPUs are divided evenly between the JVM and k6; actual affinity,
CPU model, runner image, JVM/client versions, source revision and hashes accompany
the recordings. This separates the campaign from the developer's machine, but
hosted runner hardware and images can still vary.

Each workload summary contains all three trial rows and excerpts from native
JFR reports. The final job provides a campaign overview and links to downloadable
outputs. HTTP timings cover complete response bodies; SSE timings cover streams;
WebSocket timings distinguish message round-trip from complete session duration.
Slow-client callbacks pause in user code; they do not throttle the network socket.
Percentiles remain per trial. Overload throughput divides each plateau's completed
request count by its duration; native tagged rates use the whole run duration.

Artifacts retain complete JFR recordings, native k6 HTML dashboards, compressed
raw time series, summary JSON, logs, process monitoring and full JFR CLI views.
JFR starts after warmup and spans the full measured k6 invocation, including
client initialization/setup, drain and output finalization. Recordings can therefore
last longer than the offered-load phase. JFR is explicitly stopped before JVM shutdown. Cancellation
recovery is best-effort; incomplete evidence stays visibly marked. Artifact sizes
and expiry are shown in summaries. Upload or storage-quota failures block
successful publication; the workflow does not change billing settings.

All measured runs include profiling and raw-output overhead. Ten seconds is the
chosen warmup duration, not a guarantee of steady JIT state. These measurements
provide diagnostics rather than an automatic latency-regression gate. Inspect
the native data before attributing a change to Shoostr.

The fixture remains the `:benchmarks` Gradle module, now located in this directory.
Normal builds compile and check it; they do not execute timed campaigns. Targeted
JMH diagnostics remain in the separate `microbenchmarks` module.
